## Project Purpose
ML1000 - Machine Learning in Business Context, York University. 
Assignment #1 - Classification with Supervised Learning

## Directory Structure
* Report document: **Covid_Analysis.pdf**.  
* **Rmarkdown** folder contains the Markdown file and inputs required to generate the report. If running the Markdown file yourself, we recommend running the code in covid_models.r to generate and save the logistic regression model, as it was too large to be uploaded.
* **Shiny** folder includes the source code and input required to run the shiny app.
* **other_code** folder contains supplementary scripts that were not included in the final report.

## Shiny App
URL: [Predicting COVID-19 Mortality using Machine Learning](https://sean-z.shinyapps.io/covid_analysis/)
